Well, well, to update this, I (Niz) decided to make it as a mandatory "Mod" (although it can be deleted) so that it has better management of file issues, some files that are dependent, such as boyfriend, icon defult or the main stage and sounds will be put in assets/, NOTE, I recommend creating a separate mod to modify all this. In any case, there will be a folder called "debugMod" where it will be a "mod" in debug form, here the temp charts will be saved, and some things necessary for editors and such nonsense...
