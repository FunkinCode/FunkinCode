# Funkin' Reworked project (The name is FridayCodeBeta, still FNFâ„¢)
This project is only a "fan game" of public code, and it is not necessary to recompile it, downloading the stable version of Windows/Linux/MacOS is enough, Android is not yet contemplated.
## IMPORTANT / README
Yay, there's basically nothing to post right now, since all the code is a bit dying, so the stable version will be out soon uwu....

### MOD LOAD/CREATE
- To load mods, just put 'em in `mods/` AND open the game or just download it and put the .zip in `mods/`
# How to mod (50 % compatible rn)
- To make mods you can press `7` in Main menu, and it open debug menu (like psych engine), run MODMAKERSTUDIO option to init da maker studio
- It makes a directory in your game, like `mods/My-Mod/` and if you want, use a IDE Editor text (like VisualStudioCode) and make it
