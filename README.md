# Funkin' Reworked project (The name is FridayCodeBeta, still FNF™)
This project is only a "fan game" of public code, and it is not necessary to recompile it, downloading the stable version of Windows/Linux/MacOS is enough, Android is not yet contemplated.
## IMPORTANT / README
Yay, there's basically nothing to post right now, since all the code is a bit dying, so the stable version will be out soon uwu....
